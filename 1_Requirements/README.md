# REQUIREMENTS

## 4'WS and 1H:

#### Who
 With view of sensing the obstacle wiper is control system is being user by all heavy vehicle/automobile user's (like car, truck, train, chopper).It can help people driving vehicles in terrain, roads, hill station and highways.

#### What

 3 LEDS are used in the wiper system.

#### When

 It is used when the key ignition is turned ON/OFF where three LED's are turned ON/OFF depending the frequency.

#### Where

IT is used in heavy vehicle/automobile
#### How
 IT  can be achieved throught the analog to digital convertor, LEDS, timer's and so on..


## SWOT ANALYSIS:

### Strengths:

a)	Automatic control of wiper system.

b)	Independancy by setting the frequency once, rather than relying on userâ€™s instruction.

c)	operating principle is very easy

d)	Can prevent faults, and can prevent accidents.

e)	Easy to construct and cheaper in cost with long durability.
	
### Weakness:

a)	May not detect all objects.

b)	Can produce false reading at certain occasion.

c)	Its has special physical limits (like covers only a certain range).

d)  Qute high cost for operations.

e)Timing interval may vary(i.e., start time of wiper)


### Opportunities:

 Technology maturity can reduce the system cost and help the user to cope with the real time environmental issues. The automobile to monitor if any obstacle is to be detected in the travelling path is to be ensured to avoid any accidents by turning on the wiper. 

### Threats:
