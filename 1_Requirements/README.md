# REQUIREMENTS

## SOFTWARE REQUIRMENTS:
- STM32CUBEIDE
- CYGWIN
- QEMU

## COMPONENTS USED IN PROJECT

- STM32F407G-DISC1


## 4'WS and 1H:

#### Who
All automobiles have wiper system and  The drive moves the two wiper arms at a certain angle across the windshield, providing a clear view for the driver and passenger while travelling.
 
#### What
The main purpose of the wiper system is to clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all times. In this project three LEDs are used to control the system.


#### When
Wipers are a small part of  any automobiles like cars,trains,truck and so on but they have a big impact on  driving and overall safety. They remove rain, snow, dirt, pollen, frost and other debris quickly. In this project when ignition system is turn on or off where the three LEDs turn on or off depending upon the frequency.
    
#### Where
Wipers system are used in automobiles.

#### How
This system has been  done by LED and Timer. 

## SWOT ANALYSIS:

### Strengths:
a) Growth in production of vehicles

b) Higher demand for luxury features

c) Automatic wiper control system

d) Less power consumption

e) Operating level is easy 
	
### Weakness:
a) May not be working at inclement weather

b) May not detect objects

c) It may also malfunction if components fail

d) Sometimes not working properly

e) High cost


### Opportunities:

a) The wiper serves to clean the windshield of the any automobile  at the front and rear. Wiper works by removing oil, dust, rainwater, and dirt that get stuck to the windshield.

b) Wipers detect moisture on the windshield and activate the wipers to help increase driver visibility.

c) Improve safety by decressing driver distraction.

### Threats:
a) Time interval may vary thereby it cause some problem on  wiper system.

b) Due to so much ice or snow on  windshield may cause the  wipers to get jammed and cause circuit overloading.

c) Accident may occur due to fault in wiper system.
